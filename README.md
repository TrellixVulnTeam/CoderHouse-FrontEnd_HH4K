## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of my own learning path I am in the need of learning how to build more robust website using nothing but code.
Having little to no experience in web development I am currently pursuing CoderHouse's Full Stack Development Career.

In order to finish the CoderHouse's introductory course on Web Development I need to build a website on my own. In order to do so
I created this repo to track and show all my work done to the course's tutor and professor.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this repo you will find all the pages, assets, stylesheets and scripts of my project which currently looks like this:

Shout out to CoderHouse team for building such an amazing course and career! This code is for education purposes so feel
free to use it as a template as of today.
